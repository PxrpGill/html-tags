        &#60;p&#62;My other cat, coloured black and white, is a sweetie. He followed
        us to the pool today, walking down the pavement with us. Yesterday
        he apparently visited our neighbours. I wonder if he recognises that
        their flat is a mirror image of ours.&#60;/p&#62;
        &#60;p&#62;Hm, I just noticed that in the last paragraph I used British
        English. But I'm supposed to write in American English. So I
        shouldn't say "pavement" or "flat" or "colour"...&#60;/p&#62;
      &#60;/div&#62;
